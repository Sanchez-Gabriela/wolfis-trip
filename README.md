# Wolfis-trip

It is an alternative for those who prefer to follow a plan rather than browsing and deciding for the places to visit.

Functionality:

* Registration
* Calendar to pick the dates to be planned.
* Dropdown selector with 12 catogories, where each selected tag will randomly generate a place. 
* The result is a list of places where each place shows name, picture, address and a short description.
